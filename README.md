# Food Packaging Eyetracking Experiment

Welcome to the Food Packaging Eyetracking Experiment!
1. Make sure to open the program "Gazepoint Control" and distance yourself appropriately from the eyetracker. ONCE YOU ARE DISTANCED APPROPRIATELY, DO NOT MOVE! We want to make sure you stay in the most ideal distance range between the eye tracker at all times during the experiment. Failure to keep proper distance may invalidate your data, and thus, waste your time.
2. Click the GREEN PLAY BUTTON (the button with a green circle and a white triangle facing to the right) to start the experiment.
3. Ask one of the researchers if you need clarification on anything, at ANY time during the experiment!
